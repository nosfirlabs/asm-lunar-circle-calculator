This script assumes that the lunar cycle is a constant 29.53 days, which is not exactly accurate. The actual lunar cycle can vary slightly due to a variety of factors, such as the gravitational pull of the sun and other celestial bodies. To get more accurate results, you would need to take these factors into account and use a more complex algorithm to calculate the date of the next full moon.
